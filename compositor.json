Start <a href=\"https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1\">here</a> and also refer <a href=\"https://api.slack.com/slack-apps\">this guide</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>At the end of the setup, you will be provided with <code>clientId</code>  and <code>clientSecret</code> tokens, please make note of them.</p>\n<p>Now, clone the repository and install the npm dependencies</p>\n<pre>$ git@github.com:rcdexta/chappie.git\n$ cd chappie\n$ npm install</pre><p>Once, you are all set, run the following command:</p>\n<pre>clientId=&lt;client_id&gt; clientSecret=&lt;client_secret&gt; port=3000 redis_url=&lt;redis_url&gt; npm start</pre><p>This will start up Chapiie in server mode&#x2026; There is one more step before we get the bot up and running. The Slack app oauth configuration should point to the local server that you just started. Refer to <code>OAuth &amp; Permissions</code> section inside the app settings page and set the redirect URL to <code>http://localhost:3000/oauth</code></p>\n<p>Now, navigate to the browser and type <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code> and you will be redirected to your team slack page asking for permissions to enable Chappie as a third-party app. Once you are done with that, Chappie will come alive!</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>MIT</p>\n"
