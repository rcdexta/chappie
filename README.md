Chappie is a slackbot for your workplace that helps you with the following:

* if part of your company is remote, Chappie can aggregate stats about who is coming to office or working from home on a particular day
* can give you reports and forecasts about who you can meet at office on a specific day
* can give you traffic updates if you are planning to commute to office on a specific day [wip]
* can be used to send reminder messages to colleagues set to be pinged at a specific time

### Demo

### Setup

The first step is to create a Slack application. Start [here](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) and also refer [this guide](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps) for more details.

At the end of the setup, you will be provided with `clientId`  and `clientSecret` tokens, please make note of them.

Now, clone the repository and install the npm dependencies

```shell
$ git@github.com:rcdexta/chappie.git
$ cd chappie
$ npm install
```

Once, you are all set, run the following command:

```shell
clientId=<client_id> clientSecret=<client_secret> port=3000 redis_url=<redis_url> npm start
```

This will start up Chapiie in server modeâ€¦ There is one more step before we get the bot up and running. The Slack app oauth configuration should point to the local server that you just started. Refer to `OAuth & Permissions` section inside the app settings page and set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/oauth`

Now, navigate to the browser and type `http://localhost:3000/login` and you will be redirected to your team slack page asking for permissions to enable Chappie as a third-party app. Once you are done with that, Chappie will come alive!
